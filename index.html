        <section class="standard-text" id="the-problem">
            <h1>Here's the situation.</h1>
            <p>One of the most pressing issues facing our world today is the problem of climate change, and how to respond to it within 
                our societal framework. With the backdrop of <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/what-is-climate-change/">
                increasing heat from fossil fuel burning,</a> the big question is how to move off of non-renewable sources of energy, 
                and on to cleaner sources. In the United States alone in 2023, only <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/">
                9% of total generated energy came from renewable sources</a> (such as geothermal, solar, and wind energy), not counting 
                another 9% from nuclear energy. Because the demand for energy is only increasing, it’s in the best interest for the 
                human race and for the planet’s climate to find other ways to harness it, without causing further harm to our 
                environment.</p><br><br>
            <p>One way we can boost our output of renewable energy is by using new developments in certain established sectors, like 
                solar power. However, some challenges exist with our current implementation of solar power. Solar panels are only able 
                to collect their maximum potential of energy during ideal conditions (such as with full, uninterrupted sunlight),
                <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/SOLARIS/Space-Based_Solar_Power_overview">
                    as per the European Space Agency's observations. </a> So, how can we get around these problems and make something 
                    like solar more viable for large-scale energy generation?</p>
        </section>

        <section class="standard-text" id="the-solution">
            <h1>Here's the solution.</h1>
            <p>Fortunately, a conceptual solution exists - <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/SOLARIS/Space-Based_Solar_Power_overview">
                put the solar panels in space, where they are less obstructed, and figure out a way to pull the energy back to Earth.
            </a> Referred to as “Space-Based Solar Power”, the idea is that a satellite containing a sizable array of solar panels will 
            be able to constantly get energy, and beam it back to Earth or another settlement. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/space-based-solar-power">
                According to the U.S. Department of Energy,</a> there are two paradigms for transferring power from the satellite to a 
                receiving station. Basing the design around microwave transmission means the satellite can hold and transfer more energy, 
                but is estimated to be much more expensive to produce - in the realm of around $10 billion. Laser transmission on the 
                other hand is more cost-effective, but the smaller satellite designs based on this method do not have as much capability 
                for energy generation and transfer.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="standard-text" id="design">
            <h1>Design</h1>
            <p>The design of the Power Bank draws on the concepts posited by the ESA and US Department of Energy. Using the concept of both 
                an array of solar panels, and reflective mirrors to direct sunlight to the solar arrays for maximum light intake, a Power 
                Bank will be able to send out energy, and, depending on how advances in microwave energy transfer pan out in the next two 
                decades, may also be able to take in energy from other Power Banks. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/space-based-solar-power">
                    Concepts for microwave receiving stations currently need a large area of land,</a> so in order for this to work they 
                    would need to be made much, much smaller to be attached to a satellite.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Below are some sketches for the satellite design.</p>

            <h1>Extrapolation</h1>
            <p>In addition to helping power Earth, the deployment of Power Banks may work well in tandem with future lunar settlements. 
                Within a 20-year timeframe, the development of SBSP will coincide with such lunar excursions as <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/">
                    NASA’s Artemis program.</a> In short, the program will allow humans to not only return to the moon, but to also facilitate the creation of 
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/general/nasas-artemis-iv-building-first-lunar-space-station/">the first lunar space station.</a> While the station is 
                    currently conceptualized as a research station, its been speculated that this development could also be a precursor to a 
                    <a href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/artemis/nasa-delays-artemis-2-moon-mission-to-april-2026-artemis-3-lunar-landing-to-mid-2027">
                        permanent lunar settlement on the south pole of the moon.</a> As part of this, Power Banks can help provide power for the settlement. 
                        Additionally, the issue of requiring a large amount of land for microwave receivers would be much less of an issue on the moon, with all of 
                        its open space.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Thanks to future advancements like The Power Bank, the ramifications of having so much more energy at our disposal would drastically change the 
                landscape of energy and make it much cleaner, reducing fossil fuels to a less dominant role in energy production around the world. Developments 
                like these also stand to benefit many high tech and/or engineering industries by combining the disciplines of energy collection, rocketry, and 
                logistics, empowering the economy to benefit from an investment in green technology. All of these benefits would come together to be a major 
                player in the fight against climate change and high fossil fuel usage.</p>
